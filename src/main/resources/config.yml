  # Chat message format is structured in the following way:
  # <prefix> <sender> <suffix> <separator> <message>
  # Note how everything is spaced out, between each tag there will be a space appended.
  # If tag is empty, it will be excluded from the chat message format
  # and if it's not present default tag value will be used instead!
  #
  # Additional notes:
  # Placeholders are replaced first, after that mini-message formatting is applied!
  # Also, legacy formatting codes such as &4 or &l will not be parsed.
  # Doing things this way allows for better, modern formatting support.
  # See https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html for available formatting.

    # Prefix tag, by default this tag will not appear in the chat message format.

    # Sender tag, pretty self-explanatory - represents whoever sent the message.
    # Internal placeholders available:
    # - %player%, senders display name component.
    sender: "<hover:show_entity:player:%player_uuid%:%player_name%>%player%</hover>"

    # Suffix tag, by default this tag will not appear in the chat message format.
    # No internal placeholders are available here.
    suffix: ""

    # Separator tag - as the name suggests separates sender and the message
    # Note: if for some reason you cannot save unicode characters,
    # it's possible to use unicode characters like this: \u00BB
    # No internal placeholders are available here.
    separator: "<dark_gray><bold>»"

    # Message content is sanitized, if sender doesn't have appropriate
    # permission to use specific formatting tag it won't be parsed.

    # Internal placeholders available:
    # - %message%, Content of the chat message.

# Note:
# If your group overwrite doesn't work its most likely you have provided invalid group *display* name
# This is caused by VaultAPI's messy handling of groups. As of 1.7.3 there is no way of obtaining group id.
# This is the following way display names are sanitized and passed to the overwrites:
# Spaces " " - Replaced by underscores "_"
# Dots "." - Removed.
# Everything is then converted to lower case e.g.:
# Sr. Moderator -> sr_moderator
